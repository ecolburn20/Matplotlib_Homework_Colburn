# Plotting_in_Python
This project contains different plots in Python using two sample data sets. The first data set is sample ride sharing data. Plots are
shown by different city types to see where ride sharing was the most and least popular. The second data set is sample pharmaceutical
data. Plots are shown to compare and contrast different drugs.
